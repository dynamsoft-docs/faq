[<< Back to FAQ index](index.md)

View the [DriversLicenseScanner sample](https://github.com/Dynamsoft/capture-vision-mobile-samples/tree/dcv_v2.6.1003/Android/DriversLicenseScanner){:target="_blank"} for how to decode the PDF417 barcode on the driver's license and parse the driver's information.

> `DynamsoftCodeParser` library is included in the sample to parse the driver's information from the barcode decoding result. A valid license is required for the `DynamsoftCodeParser` library.
