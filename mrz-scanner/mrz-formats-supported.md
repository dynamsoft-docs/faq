[<< Back to FAQ index](index.md)

The Dynamsoft MRZ Scanner JavaScript edition follows the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) Machine Readable Travel Documents (MRTD) standard and supports three major MRZ (Machine Readable Zone) formats:

---

| **Document Type**            | **Format**                      | **Description**                               |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Passport (TD3)**           | 2 lines Ã— 44 characters each     | Standard for passports                        |
| **ID Card (TD1)**            | 3 lines Ã— 30 characters each     | Used by many national ID cards                |
