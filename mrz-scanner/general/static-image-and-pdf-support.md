# Can the MRZ Scanner process static images or PDFs, or does it only work with a live camera?

[<< Back to FAQ index](index.md)

All editions of the Dynamsoft MRZ Scanner (server/desktop, mobile, and JavaScript) support scanning **static image files** in addition to live camera capture.

However, **only the server and desktop editions support direct PDF processing**. The JavaScript and mobile editions do **not** natively support PDF files; if you need to process a PDF in these editions, you must first convert the PDF into image files using an external tool or library.
