# Are there any performance options to improve accuracy or speed?

Yes. The scanner uses a multi-frame result cross filter to enhance accuracy. This filter is enabled by default, which helps reduce recognition errors by cross-verifying results across multiple frames. In [`MRZScannerViewConfig`](https://www.dynamsoft.com/mrz-scanner/docs/web/api/mrz-scanner.html#mrzscannerviewconfig), you can disable it to increase scanning speed, though this may slightly reduce accuracy.

To disable the cross filter:

```js
const mrzScanner = new Dynamsoft.MRZScanner({
    license: "YOUR_LICENSE_KEY",
    scannerViewConfig: {
        enableMultiFrameCrossFilter: false // default: false
    }
});
````

| Multi-frame cross filtering | `enableMultiFrameCrossFilter` | `false`      | Improves accuracy; disabling may increase speed |
