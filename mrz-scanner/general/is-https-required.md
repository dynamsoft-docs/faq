# Does the MRZ Scanner require HTTPS, and which browsers are supported?

Yes. The Dynamsoft MRZ Scanner JavaScript edition requires your application to be served over **HTTPS** due to browser restrictions on camera access and licensing requirements. The only exceptions are `localhost` and local file paths during development.

In addition, the scanner depends on several modern browser features, including **WebAssembly**, **Blob**, **URL/createObjectURL**, and **Web Workers**.
