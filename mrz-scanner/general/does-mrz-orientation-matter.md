# Does the orientation of the MRZ code matter?

Yes. The MRZ code must be presented in the correct orientationâ€”just like regular readable text. Rotated MRZ codes are **not** supported by the scanner.

| **Requirement**           | **Supported** |
|--------------------------|:-------------:|
| Correct orientation      | Yes           |
| Rotated orientation      | No            |

> ðŸ’¡ **Note**:  
> Always ensure the MRZ code is upright and aligned properly to guarantee reliable scanning and accurate results.
