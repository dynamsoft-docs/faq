# How can I implement continuous barcode scanning and single scan barcode scanning?

Dynamsoft Barcode Reader (DBR) supports two scanning modes on **Android** and **iOS**:

- **Single-scan mode**: the scanner automatically exits after successfully reading one barcode.
- **Continuous-scan mode**: the scanner keeps running and continuously reads barcodes until it is manually stopped.

You can refer to our official sample projects for implementation guidance.
